# 1. if the first character of the opening delimiter of the string is the
#    first non-whitespace character on the line, indent appropriately.
#
# 2. if the first character of the opening delimiter of the string is after
#    some other non-whitespace character on the line, don't indent.
#
# for 1., the appropriate position to indent to differs based on what
# the delimiter is, matching is based on:
#
#  a. ordinary string - the position of the initial "
#
#  b. long string - the position of the initial `
#
#  c. long buffer - the position of the initial ` (it comes after a @)
#
#  for a. and b., this is the left-most character of the opening delimiter.
#  for c., it is the second character of the opening delimiter (if one
#  includes the @ as part of the delimiter sequence).
#
#  it's possible to not implement 2., but it seems like it would tend to
#  lead to rather large indentation values.
#
#  note that the parser does not report positions of leading @, but rather
#  ", `, (, {, and [, so there is no need to make adjustments for long
#  buffers.
