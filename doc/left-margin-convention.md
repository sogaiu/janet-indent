# Left Margin Convention

If your source code is compliant with the [Left Margin
Convention](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Left-Margin-Paren.html)
indenting may work better.

To follow that convention in Janet's case, the characters to avoid
having in column zero (unless they are being used to indicate the
start of a top-level form) include:

* ( - Open parenthesis
* ~ - Tilde
* ' - Single quote

Docstrings and long-strings are some of the place these might be
likely to crop up, but if you use the provided indentation
functionality, it should help to prevent problems.

So far, the author's opinion is that following the convention is a
worthwhile trade-off.  What one gains in return is likelihood of
tooling working more reliably and in more contexts.  One reason for
this is that it becomes possible to rely on it as an indication of a
programmer's intent of where a top-level construct begins.  This can
be an issue for efficiency, correct operation, and robustness in the
face of code that is not-quite-right (e.g. missing delimiters).

If you don't have a particular preference, please consider following
it.
